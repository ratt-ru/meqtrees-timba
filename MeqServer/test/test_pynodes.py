# This class is meant to illustrate the pynode interface. All pynodes
# need to be derived from the Timba.pynode.PyNode class.
class PyDemoNode (pynode.PyNode):

  # An __init__ method is not necessary at all. If you do define your 
  # own for some reason, make sure you call pynode.PyNode.__init__() 
  # as done below
  def __init__ (self,*args):
    pynode.PyNode.__init__(self,*args);
    self.some_field = 1;
    self.another_field = 2;

  ## Next, we may need to keep track of the node state record. This includes
  ## initializing from this record when the node is first created. 
  ## There's three ways to do it:
  ## * The low-level way to do it is to define a set_state_impl() method
  ##   (see below).
  ## * An easier, high-level approach is to define an update_state() method.
  ## * Easiest way is to have no state at all. Does your pynode really
  ##   need "state"? If not, you can skip this entirely.
  
  ## update_state() is called when the node is first created and a full
  ## state record is available, but also when state changes, and only a
  ## partial state record is supplied. Instead of the state record, we 
  ## receive a clever object called "mystate" which encapsulates the
  ## state record with some additional semantics:
  def update_state (self,mystate):
    # mystate is a magic "state helper" object is used both to set up
    # initial/default state, and to update state on the fly later.
    
    # This does the following:
    #  - checks the incoming state record for field 'a'
    #  - if present, sets self.a = staterec.a
    #  - if not present but we're initializing the node, sets self.a = 3,
    #    and also sets staterec.a = 3 on the C++ side
    #  - if not present and not initializing, does nothing
    mystate('a',3);
    _dprint(0,"a=",self.a);
    
    # You can also use it with only one argument, without providing a 
    # default value. In this case self.field has to be initialized already.
    # The statement below does the following:
    #  - checks the incoming state record for field 'some_field'
    #  - if present, sets self.some_field = staterec.some_field
    #  - if not present but we're initializing the node, checks if 
    #    self.some_field already exists (in this case we set it up in
    #    __init__):
    #     - if yes, sets staterec.some_field = self.some_field on the C++ side
    #     - if not, raises an exception 
    #  - if staterec.some_field is not present and we're not initializing, 
    #    does nothing
    mystate('some_field');
    _dprint(0,"some_field=",self.some_field);
    
    # finally, you can check the return value of mystate() to see if
    # the state field has actually changed. This returns True if:
    #  - self.b was set from incoming state
    #  - self.b was initialized with a default value
    if mystate('b',4):
      _dprint(0,"b initialized or changed:",self.b);
     
    # and in this form, it only returns True if self.another_field
    # was set from incoming state:
    if mystate('another_field'):
      _dprint(0,"another_field changed:",self.another_field);

  ## set_state_impl() is an alternative, nuts'n'bolts style interface.
  ## If defined, this method will be called when the node is initialized
  ## (with a complete state record and initializing=True), or any time
  ## the node's state is changed (with a partial state record and 
  ## initializing=False). The method should be defined like this:
  #     def set_state_impl (self,staterec,initializing):
  ## and its return value should be either false, or else a record
  ## of stuff to be copied back into the node state record. 
  ## This whole initializing-or-not rigamarole is hard to keep track of,
  ## so I really recommend using update_state() instead.


  # Finally, we should define a get_result method. (We don't have to, but if
  # we don't, then what's the point of this node?) 
  # This is called with a request object, and a list of child results 
  # (possibly empty, if we're a leaf node)
  def get_result (self,request,*children):
    _dprint(0,"get_result: request is ",dmi.dmi_typename(request),request);
    for i,ch in enumerate(children):
      _dprint(0,"child",i,":",dmi.dmi_typename(ch),ch);
